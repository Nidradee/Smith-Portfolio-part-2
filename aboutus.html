<blockquote>
  I am a finance professional with experience in the banking services industry. I am going through my second layoff in 4 years, and I have decided to try to figure out what my true passion is. Since my favorite thing to do while in banking was to create PowerPoint presentations and templates, I decided I would do something creative. One day, while attending a resume workshop I found out about a 
  tech bootcamp and decided to sign up. My hope is to merge my finance background with my newly minted technology skill set learned during bootcamp. I also help out a small business from time to time called Detroit Sugar.
