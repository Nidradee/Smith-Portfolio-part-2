<blockquote>
   A finance professional with experience in the banking services industry was going through her second layoff in 4 years and decided to try to figure out her passion. Since her favorite this to do in banking was to create PowerPoint presentations, she decide she would do something creative, and one day while attending a resume workshop she found out an tech boot camp and decided to sign up. I also help out from time to time at Detroit Sugar.
